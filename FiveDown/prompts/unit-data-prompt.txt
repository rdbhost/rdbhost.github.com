Create a data type (a class), called Data, that stores a value and a unit.
Name the file js/dim_data.js

It should have:
  constructor(value, unit | '')
  val(optional value)  # getter/setter
  unit(optional value)  # getter/setter
  type() 
  asString()
  asBaseUnit() # converts to base unit (SI unit equiv to given unit)
  asGivenUnit(unit)

values can be numbers in fixed or floating point, booleans, vectors (2 or 3 element) as arrays, 
or text strings

asBaseUnit() returns a new Data() instance with the same quantity converted to a base unit.  
in to m, h to s, mi to m, for example.

  include as many units as possible, including:

  length, area, volume in imperial and metric
  mass, in imperial and metric
  force and power, in imperial and metric
  velocity and acceleration
  electricity resistance and capacitance
  radians and degrees (radians are base unit)
  time

use latin alphabet only for unit names


asGivenUnit() returns a 2-tuple of (Data(), conversion_factor) with the same quantity converted to given unit. 

  [ new_val, con_fac ] = orig.asGivenUnit()
  assert orig.val() * con_fac == new_val.val()
  assert orig.unit() !== new_val.unit()
