call the class Data

Create a data type (a class) that stores a value and a unit.

It should have:
  constructor(value, unit | '')
  val(optional value)  # getter/setter
  unit(optional value)  # getter/setter
  type() 
  asString()
  asBaseUnit() # converts to base unit (SI unit equiv to given unit)
  asGivenUnit(unit)

values can be numbers in fixed or floating point, booleans, vectors (2 or 3 element) as arrays, 
or text strings

asBaseUnit() returns a new Data() instance with the same quantity converted to a base unit.  
in to m, h to s, mi to m, for example.

  include as many units as possible, including:

  length, area, volume in imperial and metric
  mass
  force and power
  velocity and acceleration
  electricity resistance and capacitance
  radians and degrees (radians are base unit)
  time
