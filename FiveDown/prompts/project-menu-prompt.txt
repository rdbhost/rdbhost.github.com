New javascript will be in file js/project_menu.js

Provide click handlers and related functionality for the project menu, in index.html


onDOMLoad:
   remove all (and save one) span elements with class="sheet-selecter". save one as data-orig on div.project-menu
   read allSheetNames from sheet_loader.js
   add a span to div.project-menu for each of allSheetNames. use the saved span as a source of the correct html.
        use the key as the tag id, and the value in the inner span textContent.
   if there are none, provide a 'sheet_00' span, labeled 'Sheet 00'

   retrieve value of 'current-sheet' from localStorage, and load that sheet.
   move the corresponding span to leftmost (first) position, and give only it 'active' class
   pubsub publish recalc request

for each span.sheet-selector, add a click handler that:
  1) saves current sheet using saveSheet, and span id is the save name
  2) loads new sheet using span id as the retrieval name.
  3) save this sheet name as 'current-sheet'
  4) pubsub publish recalc request
  
for each span.sheet-selector > button.sheet-delete, add click handler that :
  1) clears the sheet
  2) remove the sheet from localStorage, 
  3) remove the span from project-menu
  4) chooses the first remaining span in list, and loads that sheet
  5) save this sheet name as 'current-sheet'
  6) pubsub publish recalc request

for span#new-sheet, create a new item in project-menu, naming it the first unused name in the
  series sheet-00, sheet-01, sheet-02, etc

a handler on visibilityChange will save the current sheet to localStorage whenever
visibility is gained or lost
  1) saving the sheet involves using scanSheet to create a data object, JSON.stringify the data object, and 
    store it in localStorage

for click delegation, remember to use event.target, rather than event.currentTarget
for single line blocks, indent but do not use brackets

every handler function longer than 5 lines should have its own name, exported
provide jsdoc comments

====================

make sheet delete a two-stage operation, similar to the plot button. on first click, the btn text 
changes to 'Please Confirm', and a setTimeout for 90 seconds reverts to its default state.  a second 
click while the button is in confirm mode will actually delete the sheet.
