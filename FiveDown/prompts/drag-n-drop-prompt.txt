  create a new module, in file:  js/drag_drop.js

  refer to index.html


  rows are draggable, with td.handle being the drag handle.  Use delegation, so drag functionality applies to rows
    added dynamically.

  there can be multiple results columns.  they are draggable, where the <th> cell is the drag handle.  they can only
    be dragged between the formula and add-result columns, so they stay grouped together.  Assume that when result
    columns are added, they have the draggable attribute and the 'result' class.
