This module to be called js/sheet-interface.js

refer to pubsub.js and index.html

Create handlers for each column.  Use delegation, so that handlers are active on every row, even when new rows have been 
  dynamically added.  Generally, prefer delegation to thead or tbody rather than table.

general rules that should be applied after each relevant change are
  1) if formula is not blank, results columns must be noneditable
  2) if any result column is editable, formula must be blank and not editable


handle 

  drag handlers already handled in table-drag.js

  double-click handler
   duplicate the tr, placing the copy immediately after the original

   add the second row to table.row_collection, using name value as the key.  If there is key duplicate, modify name 
     by prefixing '_' as many times as needed.


description - nothing 

name

  on-exit handler
    compare content to data-value attribute
      if changed, remove old value from row_collection, and add row with new name
      new name cannot be blank, unless old value was blank also
      store new name in data-value


formula 

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if so, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data

    formatting replaces '@' with a unicode dot (&dot;) and replaces * with 'x' symbol.

    if formula text changed from data-value, then trigger a recalc by sending a 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub

    if formula column has text, then all result columns should have added class="readonly output" and contenteditable=false


results

  doubleclick handler on column header 'th'
    makes header editable with contenteditable=true
    installs a one-shot focusout handler that removes contenteditable

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if found, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data, formatted similarly to table_row_handler

    if result text changed from data-value, then
      1) trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub
      2) ensure formula td is blank and contenteditable=false
      3) ensure all result fields are contenteditable=true, adding class="input"


add-result

  on column header, <th> put a click handler on the one button.
  the click handler adds a column to the table, to the right of the existing result cells, and to the left of the add-result
    column.  it has same classes as existing result columns.
  the text in the new th will have the form 'Result n' where n is the index of the new result column.  
  the first result column header will have the text Result 0 as soon as a second result column is added.


unit

  on-enter handler
    nothing for now


delete

  on the button in this td, add a click handler that deletes the row html and the row_collection entry for the row.
  the row deletion is done through a RowCollection object on the table, table.row_collection
  trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub.
