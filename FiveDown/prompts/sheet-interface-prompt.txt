This module to be called js/sheet_interface.js

refer to pubsub.js, index.html, and row_collection.js

Create handlers for each column.  Use delegation, so that handlers are active on every row, even when new rows have been 
  dynamically added.  Generally, prefer delegation to thead or tbody rather than table.

general rules that should be applied after each relevant change are
  1) if formula is not blank, results columns must be noneditable.  null and undefined count as blank.
  2) if any result column is editable (tabindex > -1 or absent) and non-blank, formula must be blank and not editable
  3) whenever contentEditable is not 'true', tabindex should be -1, and all focus related handlers should return immediately
  4) noneditable formula column should have class 'readonly'.  noneditable result columns should have classes 'readonly' and 'output'

  be thorough in enforcing rules, setting contenteditable, tabindex, and classes on each (formula and result) column explicitly.

handle 

  double-click handler
   duplicate the tr, placing the copy immediately after the original
   handler is on the handle cell only

   add the second row to table.row_collection, using name value as the key.  If there is key duplicate, modify name 
     by prefixing '_' as many times as needed.


description - nothing 

name

  on-exit handler
    compare content to data-value attribute
      if changed, and old value not blank, remove old value from row_collection, and add row with new name
      new name cannot be blank, unless old value was blank also
      store new name in data-value


formula 

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if so, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data

    formatting replaces '@' with a unicode dot (&dot;) and replaces * with 'x' symbol.

    if formula text changed from data-value, then trigger a recalc by sending a 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub

    if formula column has text, then all result columns should have added class="readonly output" and contenteditable=false


results

  the button on the results th will cause the column to be deleted.
  when a result column is deleted, the saved blank row should be changed to match.

  doubleclick handler on column header 'th'
    makes header editable with contenteditable=true
    installs a one-shot focusout handler that removes contenteditable

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if found, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data, formatted similarly to table_row_handler

    if result text changed from data-value, then
      1) trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub
      2) ensure formula td is blank and contenteditable=false
      3) ensure all result fields are contenteditable=true, adding class="input"


add-result

  on column header, <th> put a click handler on the one button.
  the click handler adds a column to the table, to the right of the existing result cells, and to the left of the add-result
    column.  it has same classes as existing result columns.
  the text in the new th will have the form 'Result n' where n is the index of the new result column.  
  the first result column header will have the text Result 0 only when its text is 'Result' and a second result column is added.

  when a result column is added, the saved blank row should be changed to match. correcting the saved blank row should not rely on
    a blank row being available in the table.


unit

  on-enter handler
    nothing for now


delete

  on this td, add a click handler that deletes the row html and the row_collection entry for the row.
  the row deletion is done through a RowCollection object on the table, table.row_collection
  trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub.


table.row_collection will be created as empty.  all the interfaces will be created in a function 'setupTableInterface(table)'
that is called from an onDOMLoad handler.  enforceRowRules and setupTableInterface will be exported.

On DOMLoad, perform the following:

1) find a blank row and save it as an attribute on table, called 'blank_row'
     a blank row is one where the cell text is "" for the columns 'description', 'name', 'formula', 'unit' and all 'result' columns.
2) delete all rows
3) run ensureBlankFive

do not add existing table rows to table.row_collection.
do not add text to any buttons, nor add any buttons

The function ensure_blank_five will look at the last rows in the table, and ensure that exactly the last five rows are blank. Remove 
extra blank lines, and insert blanks as necessary.  The blanks can be copied from the 'blank_row' attribute.

Assume that a blank row is available, and throw exceptions if not, or if blank row data attribute is not available.


========= modifications ================

change sheet_interface.js so that when a computed unit is different from textContent in unit column (and textContent is not null), a class 
'converted' is applied to the formula column in that row.

the unit column has a data attribute 'data-computed-unit'. It will have a non-null value when a unit has been computed. Rely on this, 
in combination with textContent, to set td.formula.converted
