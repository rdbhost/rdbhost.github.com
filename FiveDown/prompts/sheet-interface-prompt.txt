refer to pubsub.js and index.html

Create handlers for each column.  Use delegation, so that handlers are active on every row, even when new rows have been 
  dynamically added.


handle - drag handlers already handled in table-drag.js

description - nothing 

formula 

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if so, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data

    formatting replaces '@' with a unicode dot (&dot;) and replaces * with 'x' symbol.

    if formula text changed from data-value, then trigger a recalc by sending a 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub

    if formula column has text, then all result columns should have added class="readonly output" and contenteditable=false


results

  on-enter handler
    checks for value in data-value attribute on td cell
    if found, substitutes that value into td text, losing existing td text

  on-exit handler
    copies td text data, (even if blank) to data-value attribute on td cell
    replaces td text with a formatted version of data, formatted similarly to table_row_handler

    if result text changed from data-value, then
      1) trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalc' in pubsub
      2) ensure formula td is blank and contenteditable=false
      3) ensure all result fields are contenteditable=true, adding class="input"


add-result

  on column header, <th> put a click handler on the one button.
  the click handler adds a column to the table, to the right of the existing result cells, and to the left of the add-result
    column.  it has same classes as existing result columns.
  the text in the new th will have the form 'Result n' where n is the index of the new result column.  
  the first result column header will have the text Result 0 as soon as a second result column is added.


unit

  on-enter handler
    nothing for now


delete

  on the button in this td, add a click handler that deletes the row html and the row_collection entry for the row.
  the row deletion is done through a RowCollection object on the table, table.row_collection
  trigger a recalc by sending 'go' message on topic 'recalculation' in pubsub.
