Add a module 'js/indexeddb_db.js' that stores data in an indexeddb.  This module should have functions saveSheet(name, data), 
retrieveSheet(name), removeSheet(name) and getDeletedInOrder().

removeSheet(name) should move sheet to a deleted sheet storage system, which tracks the deletion order.  Make
this work similarly to code in localstorage_db.js.

Timestamps are NOT necessary for savedSheets.

getDeletedInOrder() returns a list of deleted_sheet* names, for all deleted sheets, in reverse order.
