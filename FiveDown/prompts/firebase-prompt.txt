Create a new module, patterned after indexeddb_db.js, to store data in a FireStore database. The access data will be stored in 
localStorage, in a json object called firestore_credentials. A last-accessed timestamp will also be stored there.
 
The functionality will be the same as the indexeddb module, but with additional event handling for online events.
 
Write two new functions for localstorage_db, that save and retrieve the credentials.

Write the new module, firestore_db.js. It will behave as follows:

1) a save function will save a sheet to the remote db, using credentials provided as arguments.
2) an all-sheets function will get all sheets stored in firestore. an all-new-sheets(last-accessed) function will get new sheets stored from other clients.
3) a retrieve function will fetch a sheet by name.
4) an event handler watching for changes in the online store will call a callback function to be defined elsewhere.



create a module, 'firebase_interface.js' that onDOMLoad, checks for firebase credentials using the localstorage_db functions, and 
enables the firebase button if not found.

in this new module, create a click handler that shows the firebase-overlay when clicked. When the overlay is displayed, a one-shot 
click handler should be created on the close button to hide the overlay.  The div#firebase-message should be cleared.


write a click-handler for the firebase-overlay firebase-submit button, that reads the textarea field, validates that it 
contains 200 - 800 characters of text including 'apiKey', then uses regular expressions to extract each of the fields and stores a 
firebase-credential object in localstorage, using functions in localstorage_db module.

If no valid data found, add an error message to div#firebase-message.


--------------------

change sheet_loader.js to save to firebase whenever saving to indexeddb and a firebase config is available. Also create an empty 
callback to provide to the firebase watcher function.

retrieve should look to firestore first (if creds available) then to indexeddb.
