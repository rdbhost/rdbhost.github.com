Create a PubSub class in the file js/pubsub.js

It will implement a Publish Subscribe feature using text topics


methods 
  
    constructor()

    subscribe(topic_name, function)

        register the function within PubSub on the topic_name


    publish(topic_name, message)

       when a message (a data object) is recieved from publish, each registered function is called with that message.

       provide a sequence break (setTimeout, maybe) so that the publish() call returns before the message is broadcast.


Also, on DOMLoad, create one instance and attach it to table#main-sheet as data['pubsub']
