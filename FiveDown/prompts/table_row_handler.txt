Provide a class TableRowHandler

1) Constructor(html segment with table row <tr></tr>)

2) update(html segment with table row)
   update and constructor will validate that row meets criteria here.

The row will have these columns
   1) handle 
   2) description
   3) name
   4) formula
   5) result 1
   5a) (optionally result 2)
       .... additional result columns
   6) add-result 
   7) unit
   8) delete

Each <td> will have a class with the above value "handle", "description" etc

3) getter/setter for each column, except handle, add-result and delete

   for example,
   name(optional new_name) returns prior name
     name cannot be blank

   description, formula, unit getters should take no parameters, meaning no setting functionality.

   result(idx, new_value=Data) returns prior value of result[idx]

      result getter/setter will also get and set the unit column, as the Data instance has both value and unit. 
      On setting:
        if unit column is empty, set it from new_value
        if unit column is set but not a match for new_value unit, convert new_value to unit in column and add class="converted" to result column

      On setting result:
        in addition to setting td text, add a data attribute 'data-value' to the td containing the same value.  The data attribute can be the full value, the text
        should be formatted to 3 decimal places, or floating point if < 0.01
        vectors should be formatted to 2 decimal places

      new_value can also be an Error object, and the Error.message should be displayed in the td, and the data-value cleared.
      only if the value is an Error, the 'error' class should be set on the td.

   Data is a class for tracking dimensioned data. both 2nd parameter to result() and return values will be Data instances
