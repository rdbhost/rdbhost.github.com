when plot btn is clicked, change button text to 'Confirm rows'. keep visibility code

when button is clicked in 'confirm rows' status, gather a list of names of rows with plotCheckbox set, and 
return button text to 'Plot'.  also, on clicking in confirm status, rehide the checkboxes

if there are 2 or more checkboxes selected, unhide the plotoverlay div.  if there are two or more rows selected, 
extract the values from the results columns for each such row.  log each 

instead of iterating over row_collection.rows, iterate over the table itself, so selected names are in display order

with first two selected row, create an SVG bar chart on the plotoverlay div
the value of a td.result is in its data-value attribute. can the chart size be sized as a fraction of the container

adjust both chart functions to take a variable number of name, value-list pairs. also implement a 
makeScatterchart function also.

also, in the lineChart, use the first row as x coordinates. when the first row is used as x values, 
it should not have its own display line or bar

rewrite makeBarchart to use chart.js.  dynamically insert a canvas element into div.plot-svg-container chart.js 
is at js/lib/chart.js

make button.plot-btn buttons function as style selectors, rerendering chart as indicated style.

move handlers into their own named functions, exported for testability

move plotBtn click handler to its own function handlePlotBtn .  move confirmMode to a data-attribute 
(or similar) attached to button.

------

content in lines 50-53 should be moved to RowCollection as method showCheckboxes(mode). mode is 'show', 'hide'

in plotBtn initial response, get a list of leaf Nodes and a list of root nodes from evaluator.js, and 
check the boxes that are in leaf nodes or root nodes

add tests that use functions, like sin() also, add tests with simple values as formulas

add function getInputNodes that finds leaf nodes without formulas
